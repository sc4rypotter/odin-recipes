    <p>
      Who can say no to a crispy potato taco? They're a staple throughout Mexico
      for good reason. After frying in batches, top these with tons of salsa
      verde and cotija cheese, or pull out your family's favorite taco night
      toppings. Bonus: These are a great way to use up leftover homemade mashed
      potatoes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) pkg mashed potatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
      <li>10 corn tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat water in a medium saucepan to boiling. Remove from the heat and
        stir in instant mashed potatoes. Mix thoroughly with a fork to moisten
        all potatoes and let stand 5 minutes. Stir in Cheddar cheese, green
        onion, and cumin.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Wrap tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave on high until warm,
        about 20 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1 tablespoon potato mixture in the center of a tortilla and fold
        over to make a taco. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, place tacos in the basket of an air fryer. Spray the
        tops with cooking spray and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer
        to a serving platter and repeat to cook remaining tacos.
